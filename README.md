Welcome! This is a brief guide on how to get started with the application.

Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the application.

4. Run the application in Visual Studio. This will start the development server and launch the application in your default web browser.

5. Once the application is running, navigate to the registration page and create a new user account. This step is necessary to initialize the database with the required tables.

6. After registering a new user, open the 'database.sql' file included in the repository.

7. Copy all the contents of the 'database.sql' file.

8. In Visual Studio, open the SQL Server Object Explorer and locate the newly created database.

9. Create a new query and paste the contents of the 'database.sql' file into the query editor.

10. Execute the query to create the necessary tables and populate the database with initial data.

11. You're all set! You can now explore and use the application.
